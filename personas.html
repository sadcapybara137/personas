    <h2> Stop and Shop Self-Checkout </h2>
        <h1> Introduction </h1>
        <center>
            <p>
                Grocery store self-checkout systems have become an increasingly popular
                alternative to checking out with a cashier. In this project, I aim to
                investigate user satisfaction with using a self-checkout interface
                at the northeastern US grocery store chain Stop & Shop. More specifically,
                I would like to answer the following questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Why do shoppers prefer self-checkout? </li>
                <li> Where are users having difficulties using self-checkout, if any? </li>
                <li> How do users feel about using self-checkout? </li>
            </ul>
        </center>

        <h1> The Interface </h1>
        <p>
            The Stop and Shop self-checkout interface features multiple components, including
            the scanner, the main screen, and the card reader.
        </p>
        <div class = "img_row">
            <div class = "img_column">

                <p>
                    The main interface Stop and Shop customers interact with is the screen in front
                    of the scanner. The screen displays the items which were scanned and allows
                    the user to checkout. There are various other options users can select
                    like entering their phone number for rewards and searching produce by
                    PLU.

        <h1> User Observations and Interviews </h1>
        <p>
            I observered people using self-checkout at my local Stop and Shop and found
            the following observations noteworthy:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Most people using self-checkout only had a few items in their cart, no one had
                a full shopping cart.
            </li>
            <li>
                Many people ran into issues with the security measures of the self-checkout system.
                Namely, if they didn't place items in the bagging area correctly it would require
                overrides from a worker.
            </li>
            <li>
                People who were using self-checkout typcially appeared to be younger.
            </li>
            <li>
                Some people would rotate items several times around the scanner looking for
                barcodes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Weighing produce requires using the screen navigation and sometimes resulted
                in needed assistance. Some users would put items on the scale before
                initiating the weighing screen.
            </li>
            <li>
                Some people would forget to scan items places in the lower basket of the cart.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I interviewed three users of Stop and Shop's self-checkout interface and asked the
            following questions:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Do you enjoy grocery shopping? </li>
                <li> Have you used self-checkout in the past? If so,
                how often?
                </li>
                <li> Why do you use self-checkout? </li>
                <li> Do you have any difficulties using self-checkout?
                    <ul>
                        <li> If so, why?</li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li> Is using self checkout faster than a cashier?
                    <ul>
                        <li> If so, why?</li>
                        <li> If not, why?</li>
                    </ul></li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            From the interviews, I learned that shoppers generally feel neutral
            about going to the grocery store and have used self-checkout in the past.
            Some people use self-checkout in particular if the lines for a cashier are
            too long, the convenience of less human interaction, and having control
            of how groceries are bagged. Interviewees' often had issues with self-checkout
            because the system is easily set off by security measures. For example, there
            are spots on both sides of the interface to put groceries, but if you
            scan an item and place it to the left, the interface calls for assistance.
            Interviewees generally believed self-checkout is faster, with one
            interviewee specifying that self-checkout is faster for smaller trips.
        </p>
        <p>
            From my interviews and observations, I made the following personas:
        </p>
        <div class = "img_row">
            <div class = "img_column">
                <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/1XK07jc4/dave.png" style="width:100%">
                <p> Dave is a middle-aged 9-to-5 worker with a wife and kids. He
                tries to help out around the house by doing grocery shopping after work.
                Dave doesn't always pay attention to what he is doing, yet is generally
                confident. Dave struggles with using the interface because he
                places items outside the bagging area, causing the system to ask for
                assistence. Additionally, he doesn't realize that he has to scan his
                Stop and Shop card for sale items. This persona represents my interviewees
                    because most expressed frustration with needing assistance during self-checkout.
                    While observing users, I noticed some did not use their card at the machine.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "img_column">
                <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/x18Fzv4Z/phil.png" style="width:100%">
                <p> Phil is a college student who ocassionally goes to the grocery store
                    for things he can't get on his meal plan. He is introverted and shopping
                    easily makes him feel stressed. His difficulty with using the interface
                    is finding barcodes and getting them to scan properly. This persona relates
                    to my experience of watching users rotate items many times to scan them.

    <h1> Storyboarding </h1>
        <p> To give the persona additional context, I created a storyboard covering
        the "Dave" persona, illustrating his difficulties using the grocery store
        self-checkout: </p>
